# Welcome
This is the landing page for the Pacific Northwest citizen science community. The purpose of this webpage is to highlight the citizen science projects in the region and share resources. 

## Citizen Science

Citizen science is a term for research championed by people without formal scientific backgrounds.

>We all have a little bit of scientist in us, it is reason we are curious. Citizen science projects provide opportunities to release our inner scientist.

There are many ways people without formal scientific backgrounds can contribute to research. For example, the University of Washington's [Center for Game Science](http://centerforgamescience.org/) hosts several exciting games and puzzels that advance knowledge (check out [Foldit](https://fold.it/) or [Mozak](https://www.mozak.science/landing) to solve helpful puzzels about protein folding or neural networks). However, the focus on this webpage and community is on projects that need outdoor participation. 

### Outdoor Citizen Science Projects in the Pacific Northwest

Below is a list of outdoor citizen science projects active in the Pacific Northwest (not exhaustive, under revision)

```{r echo=FALSE}
ProjectList <- read.csv("./files/data/Project List.csv")
#ProjectList <- arrange(ProjectList,State)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(ProjectList,align="c") %>% kable_styling(c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive",full_width=F)) %>% scroll_box(width = "95%", height = "700px") #valign?
```


Check back soon for open methods to modify the list. In the meantime, please contact [JM Hulbert](mailto:hulbe@wsu.edu).
