# Upcoming Event! 

*RSVP [here](https://forms.gle/fCqouVBdTyW7xnUW8) by May 20th!*

## Pacific Northwest Citizen Science - Networking Evening at Woodland Park Zoo! 

**Join us for a Project Fair and Networking Event at Woodland Park Zoo on May 25th!** 

Do you lead a scientific research project that involves participation by volunteers? Do you coordinate volunteers to participate in a scientific research project? Do you participate as a volunteer in a scientific research project? Whether you call it community science, citizen science, public participation in scientific research or something else, if this is a focus and/or interest of yours, we invite you to join this regional networking event! 

This event complements the concurrent national [C*Sci22 conference](https://citizenscience.org/c-sci-2022/) (but registration for the national event is not required to attend this regional gathering). This event also serves as a lead-up to a regional Pacific Northwest Citizen Science Summit being planned for October 2022 to be held in the Portland, OR area with virtual participation options (dates TBD).

## Citizen Science

Citizen science is a term for research championed by people without formal scientific backgrounds. 

**Every person is a citizen of the world.**

>"We are curious because we all have a little bit of scientist in us. Citizen science projects provide opportunities for us to release that inner scientist." - JM Hulbert

There are many opportunities for anyone to contribute to scientific research. For example, the University of Washington's [Center for Game Science](http://centerforgamescience.org/) hosts many exciting games and puzzles that provide fun ways to advance knowledge.

* Check out [Foldit](https://fold.it/) or [Mozak](https://www.mozak.science/landing) to solve helpful puzzles about protein folding or neural networks, respectively. 

* Check out [OrcaSound](https://www.orcasound.net/listen/) to listen for and document interesting underwater sounds.
