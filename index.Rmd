# Welcome
This is the (temporary) landing page for the Forest Health Defenders program. 

## Citizen Science

Citizen science is a term for research championed by people without formal scientific backgrounds. 

>We all have a little bit of scientist in us, it is reason we are curious. 

Here you can release your inner scientist by joining us to advance knowledge and keep trees healthy in the PNW.

## The Research

Trees are ecologically, culturally and economically important to the PNW. The objective of this program is to coordinate open research to keep trees healthy. 

## Become a Forest Health Defender

Stay tuned for more information about opportunities to be involved or contribute to the research. 

# Western redcedar decline (pilot project) {.tabset .tabset-fade}

![Decline observed at Gas Works Park in Seattle, January 2019.](files/images/WesternRedcedarDeclineCropped.jpg)

## *Concern*

Many reports have expressed concern about the increased levels of western redcedar decline in the PNW.

## *Importance*

* The western redcedar (*Thuja plicata*) is critically important to protect because of its ecological, cultural and economic value.
    + This species grows widely throughout the PNW because of its tolerance to shade, flooding and nutrient poor soils. 
    + Here, it provides habitat and nourishment for many mammal and bird species and has high commercial value because of its durability and resistance to wood rotting fungi. 
    + It is also used widely in restoration activities locally and as an ornamental species internationally. 
    + It is also considered a Cultural Keystone Species because its multiple uses and value to indigenous North American peoples. 

> Therefore, conserving *T. plicata* is a critically important for protecting the cultural heritage, timber economy and forest ecosystems of the PNW.

## *Research*

Join us to map the extent of the decline and determine if it is entirely linked to recent climate data or if there are other biotic factors involved (e.g. insect pests or diseases).
